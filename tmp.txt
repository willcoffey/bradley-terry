FREQUENCY

Calculates the frequency distribution of a one-column array into specified classes.
Sample Usage

FREQUENCY(A2:A40,B2:B5)
Syntax

FREQUENCY(data, classes)

    data - The array or range containing the values to be counted.

    classes - The array or range containing the set of classes.
        classes should be sorted for clarity, but FREQUENCY will sort the values specified internally if they are not and return correct results.

Notes

    The output of FREQUENCY will be a vertical range of size one greater than classes as the final value is the number of elements in data greater than any of the class boundaries.
